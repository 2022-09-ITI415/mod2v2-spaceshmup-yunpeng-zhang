Weapon properties remake & New Weapon added:

| Weapon  | Shots | Dmg/Shot | Firerate | Speed |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Blaster | 1 | 1 | 0.2 | 50 |
| Spread | 5 | 3 | 1 | 40 |
| Phaser | 1 | 2 | 0.2 | 50 |

Blaster is the common weapon in my game, quick firerate and speed with multiple weapons fire at the same time can deal huge damage in a line.

Spread shot speed is the longest but has huge damage per shot. Because I tested it a few times and found that it was too amazing when the spread had 5 weapons fired at the same time, so I greatly increased its time between per shot.

Except that the damage of Phaser is a little higher than that of Blaster, the other attributes are exactly the same. The price paid for this "1 point of damage" may be different in that the projectile of Phaser is very distorted and unpredictable, but it can shoot when stationary and hit the enemies on the left and right sides. , so the operating feel depends on the player's personal preference.

I added the setting of the weapon used by the enemy, the Blaster and the 3-round Spread used by Enemy1 and Enemy3 respectively. Because the enemy refreshes quickly and cannot be killed in a very fast time, it is difficult to avoid bullets when the enemy piles up. Therefore, I greatly extended the frequency of enemy shooting and the spread angle of the spread to prevent players from accidentally catching 3 enemy bullets and dying quickly.
